### Goal
In this project, you are asked to make a **small video game** based on the rules of **Duck Hunt**.    
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:    
‚Ä¢ the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.    
‚Ä¢ ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.    
‚Ä¢ the player can click on them to shoot them.    

In my version of the game, the story takes place in the world of **Terraria**.    
You're no longer a hunter, but a **player** being attacked at night by **demon eyes**.    
_Will you manage to kill them all ?_

### How to compile it ?
Make the game :
```shell
make
```

Re make the game :
```shell
# This command will deleted all the compiled files
make re
```

Remove all compiled files (*.o) :
```shell
make clean
```

Remove all compiled files (*.o) and the libmy.a file :
```shell
make fclean
```

Make the game and launch it :
```shell
# This command will "make re" the game
make run
```

Make a unit_tests file :
```shell
make unit_tests
```

Make and run a unit_tests file with the coverage :
```shell
make tests_run
```

Make the game and valgrind it :
```shell
make valgrind
```
